# Project 2: A/B testing for a landing page - regression with covariates

This projects focuses on the analysing the results of an A/B test for a new landing page of an e-commerce website. The experiment was run in three countries with different sampling sizes. First, I have done some data cleaning and conducted sanity checks. Then, to control for covariates (country of users), I have built a logistic regression model and interpreted the results.

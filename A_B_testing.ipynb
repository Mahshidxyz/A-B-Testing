    "## Experiment Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses had two options on the course overview page: \"start free trial\", and \"access course materials\". If the student clicks \"start free trial\", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:** In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough time—without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit of diversion:** The unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page.\n",

    "#### Estimating Standard Deviation for Evaluation Metrics for a sample size of 5000 \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming our evaluation metrics are probabilities that are binomially distributed, we can analytically estimate the standard deviation using the binomial standard deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*} SD = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1−p)}{n}} \\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $p$ is the probability and $n$ is the sample size. When the unit of diversion in the experiment is not equal to the unit of analysis (the denominator of the metric formula), variance might be different and we need to estimate it empirically. Here unit of diversions and the denominator are cookies for Gross Conversion and Net Conversion; therefore, analytical estimation is good. However, for the Retention metric the denominator of the metric (unit of analysis) is enrolled users while the unit of diversion is cookie. Therefore, if the data was provided it would be best to calculate the variability of the retention metric empirically.\n",

    "This experiment was designed to determine whether encouraging the students with not enough time to skip enrollment and audit the course instead would improve the overall student experience and allow coaches to support students who are likely to complete the course. A statistically and practically signficant decrease in Gross Conversion was observed accompanied with no significant change in Net Conversion. This is actually in line with the test hypothesis which hoped for reducing gross conversion but not significantly reducing the net conversion (number of students who continue past the free trial and may eventually complete the course). Therefore, my recommendation is to launch this experiment."
